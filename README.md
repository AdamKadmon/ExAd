Exile Addons - originally small projects developed for the Arma Exile communities EXO and SP4R but now rewritten and collected here for public use. 

I'll gradually add all features I built, encouragements always helps the project to stay alive a little longer <img src="http://kindmedscolorado.vmgagencysites.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kind-Meds-Smiley.png" alt=":D" width="20" /> | [Donate here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=jan%2ebabor%2e383%40gmail%2ecom&lc=GB&item_name=ExAd&currency_code=EUR&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted)
