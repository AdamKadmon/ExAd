  "body": "## Welcome to the ExAd Project \r\nExAd - Exile Addons is a project where I, @Bjanski, will continuously add all my plugins and addons I written for the Exile community. I've had some issues deciding how I shall make it easy for people to add and remove specific features from the package. They way it's developed now is with a Core plugin and addon that holds all the essential code to make all plugins and addons work, e.g. it takes care of all client<->server request that the ExAd features will use, after installing the core you can just go to the documentation and choose what feature you want and follow the instructions to implement it into your server. It's really important that you follow the installation steps since I'm not gonna help with small issues. If you encounter any ambiguous instructions send me a PM on [Exile](http://www.exilemod.com/profile/7143-janski/)\r\n\r\n## Addon/Plugins\r\n### Core \r\nSmall package including utillity functions that are use by the other plugins and addons.  \r\nA framework to allow the addons/plugins to send and interpret data between the server and client. \r\n### Halo & Parachute\r\nFeature that allows the player to always be able to pull a parachute and now also detach from the parachute with a key combination (alt shift x). \r\n### Virtual Garage\r\nTo avoid performance issues I developt this feature for the EXO Community, which simply allows you to despawn vehicles into a virtual garage and then also spawn them back. This version is slightly different since this one uses the Improved XM8 Apps to interact with the Virtual Garage system. \r\n### Grinding .. _Coming soon_\r\n### Hacking .. _Coming soon_\r\n### Admin Events .. _Coming soon_\r\n### Upgrade Vehicles .. _Coming soon_\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with ExAd?
