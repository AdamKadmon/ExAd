  "body": "## Welcome to the ExAd Project \r\nExAd - Exile Addons is a project where I, @Bjanski, will continuously add all my plugins and addons I written for the Exile community. I've had some issues deciding how I shall make it easy for people to add and remove specific features from the package. They way it's developed now is with a Core plugin and addon that holds all the essential code to make all plugins and addons work, e.g. it takes care of all client<->server request that the ExAd features will use, after installing the core you can just go to the documentation and choose what feature you want and follow the instructions to implement it into your server. It's really important that you follow the installation steps since I'm not gonna help with small issues. If you encounter any ambiguous instructions send me a PM on [Exile](http://www.exilemod.com/profile/7143-janski/)\r\n\r\n## Addon/Plugins  \r\n### Core  \r\nSmall core package including utility functions that are use by the package plugins.  \r\nA framework to audit and allow the package plugins to send and interpret data between the server and client. Just makes it more secure and easier this way :)  \r\n\r\n### Halo & Parachute\r\nFeature that allows the player to always be able to pull a parachute and now also detach from the parachute with a key combination (alt shift x).  \r\n\r\n### Virtual Garage\r\nTo avoid performance issues I developed this feature for the EXO Community, which simply allows you to store vehicles into a virtual garage and then also retrieve them back. This version is slightly different since this one uses the Improved XM8 Apps to interact with the Virtual Garage system.  \r\n\r\n### Grinding\r\nCreates an opportunity for all players to remove a lock from a door and get into other player bases.  \r\nThis is possible if you have a **Exile_Item_Grinder** and multiple **Exile_Magazine_Battery** in your inventory.\r\n\r\n### Hacking .. _Coming soon_\r\nAllows users to start a hacking mission, a defend mission where a computer is hacking the base network and all players will be notified and get an opportunity take over the hack or interrupt the hack. depending on what you hack a safe can be unlocked or random vehicle can be fetched from the bases Virtual Garage. \r\n\r\n* This mission is dependent that the Virtual Garage has been installed.   \r\n\r\n### Admin Events .. _Coming soon_  \r\nAllows Infistar admins to start fully automatic admin events, no observation necessary, such as;\r\n* Hunger Games  \r\n* Heli Wars  \r\nMore mission will be created over time or you create them on you own.  \r\n\r\n### Upgrade Vehicles .. _Coming soon_\r\nLets a player upgrade vehicles from one class to another with a specific recipe.  \r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with ExAd?
