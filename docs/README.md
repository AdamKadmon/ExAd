## How to Update  
Since this project consist of multiple sub projects I've had some issues deciding how to structure the project for a simple update process. 

To simplify the proccess for me, I've decided to simply devide everything and leave a changelog and update instructions in every subprojects client folder. This way you won't miss any information related to that subproject and it will be simple for me to keep the track off all changes with out skimming a general changelog.
